whats the difference

python src/faf/mcp_server.py

vs 

faf-mcp command?

my current cursor ide uses command


> functionality as tools that can be invoked by MCP clients.

tools translate request to JSONs file which are storred in a preferred location for further processing, integrations

> fastmcp[cli]

do we use cli?

> SERVER_DESCRIPTION = "MCP server for Fire And Forget (FAF) command-line tool"

command line - remove

> def validate_non_empty_string(value: str, field_name: str) -> None:

validation logic should be part of the main faf not mcp i think

dosctring - how to share them - copy them from the main code?
